# Pomodoro

## Background and Problem Description

The ideea of the app arised from the own need of such an app that can handle my studying sessions. The problemwith current software that tries to achieve the same thing is that most software inserts ads or tries to do more that it's purpose, making it cumbersome to use.

## User/Target Groups

Portfolio visitors, future employers, colleagues, and friends and myself. These individuals will have a wide variation in age and technical abilities.

## Market

There are several similar applications available already today. However, these application have not fulfilled my own expectations because of ads intrusion or additions of unnecessary functionality.

## Requirements

### MVP:

The user will input time for his/hers study and pause sessions and the timer would run them one after another.

The user is able to pause, start and reset the current session

The app asks user for consents regarding storing data in localstorage.

The input time of the study session and pause session will be stored for future reference.

The application is available over the internet.

### Future Development

The app will be made as a PWA, available offline

The app will keep track of study sessions and after a number of study sessions would offer a longer pause session time

Notification will be implemented to signal to the users the switch bewen study session or pause session

The front end would offer dark mode and light mode to the user and store the preferences for future refference.
